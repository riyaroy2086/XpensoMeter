###### Xpensometer is capable of tracking the user's budget (income and expense) . Speechly's voice  capabilities makes it more convenient for the user. 
###### I have built the XpensoMeter in order to learn State Management in React, Context API, Local Storage and more of Material UI . I've added voice capabilities to your applications using Speechly. I have used Snackbar , date formatting for better user experience .
